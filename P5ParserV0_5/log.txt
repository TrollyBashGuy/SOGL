     -9*"D√⅜‘⁴"Hοr‘¹t x9*o±t
Explanation:
                              
     -9*                      pushes "-" repeated 9 times
        "D√⅜‘                 pushes compressed string of "|       |"
             ⁴                copies the 2nd-from-top from stack ("---------")
              "Hοr‘           pushes compressed string of "|   |   |"
                   ¹          converts all the strings in the stack to an array ["---------","|       |","---------","|   |   |"]
                    t         prints the array with newlines without popping
                      x9*     push "x" repeated 9 times
                         o    output that
                          ±t  output the array inverted
