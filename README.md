# SOGL
A very weakly typed language, meaning that every function will do something for all types of input.  
For example, 05AB1E has a function `u` for uppercasing and `Ã®` for ceiling, but SOGL has one for both - `U`.  
You'll never need to uppercase a number and take the ceiling of a string, will you?  
This makes the language very complex, but makes many more free characters available.  
If anything, then kolmogorov-complexity is the languages strong side.  

note: this language is very much in developement, and can, and probably will change a lot in the future, so if used, always keep the version number a program was made for.

##To run a program, 
  - download [the source](https://github.com/dzaima/SOGL/blob/master/P5ParserV0_8_2/P5ParserV0_8_2.zip)
  - in the data folder, in p.sogl, in the first line paste the source, 
  - in the following lines - input.
  - the output will be in log.txt and debug stuff in loge.txt
