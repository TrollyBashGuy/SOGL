# SOGL
a golfing language focused on making every single command character work on every possible type of input.
If anything, then kolmogorov-complexity is the languages strong side.

To run a program, 
  - download [the source](https://github.com/dzaima/SOGL/blob/master/P5ParserV0_5/P5ParserV0_5.zip)
  - in the data folder, in p.sogl, in the first line paste the source, 
  - in the following lines - input.
  - the output will be in log.txt and debug stuff in loge.txt

Find what each char does in [here](https://github.com/dzaima/SOGL/blob/master/charDefsParser/data/charDefs.txt).
